# Overview

This project allowed me to idendify and understand the root causes for returns amongst a data set that represented a super market.

Questions Posed During The Project
Is there a correlation between sales and returns?
Is there a product category that returns at a higher rate?
Does regionality affect return rate?
Does seasonality affect return rate?

Functionality
